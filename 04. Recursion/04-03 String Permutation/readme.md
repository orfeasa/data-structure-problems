# String Permutation

## Problem

Given a string, write a function that uses recursion to output a list of all the possible permutations of that string.
For example, given s='abc' the function should return ['abc', 'acb', 'bac', 'bca', 'cab', 'cba']

_Note_: If a character is repeated, treat each occurrence as distinct, for example an input of 'xxx' would return a list with 6 "versions" of 'xxx'

## Code

Create your solution in the form:

```python
def permute(s):
    pass
```

## Example

```python
>>> permute('abc')
['abc', 'acb', 'bac', 'bca', 'cab', 'cba']
```
