# Reverse a String

## Problem

Reverse a string using recursion.
Again, make sure you use _recursion_ to accomplish this. **Do not slice (e.g. string[::-1]) or use iteration, there must be a recursive call for the function.**

## Code

Create your solution in the form:

```python
def reverse(s):
    pass
```

## Example

```python
>>> reverse('hello world')
'dlrow olleh'
```
