# Sentence Reversal

## Problem

Given a string of words, reverse all the words. For example:

Given:

```python
'This is the best'
```

Return:

```python
'best the is This'
```

As part of this exercise you should remove all leading and trailing whitespace. So that inputs such as:

```python
' space here'
```

and

```python
'space here '
```

both become:

```python
'here space'
```

## Code

Create your solution in the form:

```python
def rev_word(s: str) -> str:
    pass
```

## Examples

```python
>>> rev_word('Hi John,   are you ready to go?')
'go? to ready you are John, Hi'
>>> rev_word('    space before')
'before space'
```
